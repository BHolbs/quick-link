# quick-link
A quick and dirty link shortener to practice out some more React and AWS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses AWS Lambda for the backend, the code that runs on the backend in response to a GET/POST request are located in the `py` folder in the root directory of this repository.
Since this project is very simple and straightforward, I edit the code directly in the AWS Console if the backend requires changes, so there are no scripts to deploy using the AWS CLI (yet).

Because this application uses AWS's Free Tier, I do not leave the link public. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you would like to have the link to the hosted app on AWS Amplify.
